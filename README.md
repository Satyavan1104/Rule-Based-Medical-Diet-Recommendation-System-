# Rule-Based Medical Diet Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Rule-Based Medical Diet Recommendation System** is an expert system designed to generate **personalized diet plans** based on user health parameters, dietary preferences, and lifestyle information. The system uses **rule-based reasoning (if–then rules)** derived from medical nutrition guidelines to ensure transparent and explainable recommendations.

This project is developed for **academic and educational purposes**, demonstrating the application of **expert systems and rule-based inference** in the healthcare domain.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze user health and lifestyle data  
- Apply predefined medical and nutritional rules  
- Generate personalized, meal-wise diet recommendations  
- Provide explainable and transparent outputs  
- Demonstrate rule-based system architecture in healthcare  

---

## 🧠 System Architecture
The system follows a **layered architecture**:
- **User Interface Layer** – Collects user input and displays results  
- **Application Logic Layer** – Parsing, rule retrieval, inference, and diet generation  
- **Knowledge & Data Layer** – Stores nutrition rules and food datasets
