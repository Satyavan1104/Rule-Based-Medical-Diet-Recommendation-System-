## Performance Analysis
- The system demonstrates sub-100ms performance for all profile types
- Constraint building is consistently the fastest operation (<5ms)
- Food filtering scales linearly with food database size
- Full recommendation time is dominated by filtering and meal planning
- Complex multi-condition profiles show higher but still acceptable performance
